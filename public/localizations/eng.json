        "question1": "What can I do with this app?",
        "answer1": "This app allows you to regenerate the QR Code containing the Digital Green Covid-19 Certification (DGCC) so that it is less dense and consequently more readable by verification apps.",
        "question2": "What do I have to do to generate the new QR Code?",
        "answer2": "There are two ways to provide the original QR Code: by pressing the \"Choose file\" button and selecting the valid QR Code image from the device archive, or by starting the scanning through the camera by pressing the \"Scan QR with camera\" button and framing the QR Code. Both procedures automatically generate a new QR Code, which can be saved by pressing the \"Download\" button.",
        "question3": "Is this site safe? What happens to my Covid-19 Certification?",
        "answer3": "The site is developed purely in JavaScript, a technology that allows the DGCC to be processed in the browser without sending data over the network. The application does not send or save the content of the Green Pass in any way, and the certificate is not modified.",
        "adv-ans3": "Upon loading the home page, all necessary components are loaded in such a way that they remain static and there is no network communication during the loading and processing of the user's QR Code. Some implementation details and libraries used in the sensitive data manipulation processes are given below:",
        "adv-ans3-file-sel1": "File selection",
        "adv-ans3-file-sel2": "To load the QR Code image from the file system, the Qr-Scanner library is used. In the case of manually loading a file, JavaScript requires the creation of a URL object in order to access the user-supplied image; this process is considered a network request by some browsers, as shown in the following example image:",
        "adv-ans3-file-sel3": "Nevertheless, this request is not actually sent over the network and proof of this is the fact that generation can be done offline and the request does not have a remote address as in the following example image:",
        "adv-ans3-qr-scan1": "QR scan",
        "adv-ans3-qr-scan2": "To scan the QR Code the Html5-QRCode library is used. Unlike the previous library, this one allows JavaScript to read the content of the image directly from the MediaStream stream, avoiding the creation of a blob object and the resulting URL which in some cases is considered as a network request.",
        "adv-ans3-qr-gen1": "QR code generation",
        "adv-ans3-qr-gen2": "To decode the content of the original QR Code the DCC-Utils library is used, while for the generation of the new QR Code the QR-Code-Styling library is used. Once the decoding is done, the content is passed without any changes to the QR generator, which transforms it into the new QR Code using the value \"L\" as an error correction parameter, resulting in a lower density of the QR Code compared to the original value \"M\".",
        "question4": "What is the meaning of \"Support EU Verification Apps\" and \"Support Italian Verification App\"?",
        "answer4": "Currently the Italian verification app VerificaC19 does not check a sequence of characters placed at the beginning of the QR Code content, so our app removes this prefix to minimize the density of the new QR Code, without affecting the rest of the content. Many other European verification apps do check this sequence, so we have provided the possibility to generate a slightly denser DGCC, but compatible with European specifications.",
        "question5": "Is the DGCC provided here as good as the original one?",
        "answer5": "Of course! No manipulations are made to the certification content: if your original Green Pass is accepted by the verification apps, then the one provided here will be valid as well. In case you want to use the new QR Code in other European countries, please make sure to select the option \"Support EU verification apps\" during the generation process.",
        "adv-ans5": "In particular, the prefix string that is ignored by the verification of the Italian VerifyC19 app is the wording \"HC1:\", which identifies the version of the digital certificate and consequently the encoding and generation process carried out on it, as defined by the European specifications.",
